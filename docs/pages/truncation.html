<h1>Legendre Polynomials<a class="headerlink" href="#legendre-polynomials" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Spectral element solvers such as Nek5000, Neko by
 and NekRS by
 discretize the domains with high
order finite elements, each of them containing a number of
Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre collocation points that allow them to perform
numerical differentiation and integration thanks to numerical
quadrature. A good characteristic of these points is that a set of
polynomials known as the  form
an orthogonal basis <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span> around them, therefore the value
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span> of a known function at point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> can be represented as a
sum of the values of the orthogonal basis at different orders scaled by
a set of Legendre coefficients <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{u}\)</span> as follow:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[u(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{N}\hat{u}_i\phi_i(x)\]</div>
<p>The polynomials of order 0 and 1 are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi_0(x)=1\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi_1(x)=x\)</span>, respectively, and the rest are obtained with the
recursive formula:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[(i+1)\phi_{i+1}(x)=(2i+1)\phi_{i}(x)-(i)\phi_{i-1}(x), \quad i=1,..N,\]</div>
<p>For convenience we also define now the integration weight matrix
produced by the GLL quadrature:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[W_{ij}=\frac{2}{N(N+1)}\frac{1}{\phi^2_N(x_i)}\delta{ij}.\]</div>
<p>Although eq.  works for the value in a single
point, in numerical methods we are often interested in a set of them.
Therefore, if we define <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\textbf{u}=[u_0, u_1, ... u_{N-1}]\)</span>, it
is possible to transform the entire array by using a transformation
matrix as follows:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\textbf{u}=T\hat{\textbf{u}},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{ij}^T=f_j\phi_{i}(x_j)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_j\)</span> are scaling
factors that make <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> orthogonal with respect to the integration
weights such that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T^TWT=I\)</span> and are defined as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}f_j=
 \begin{cases}
      \sqrt{(2(j+1)-1)/2} &amp; 0\leq j\leq N-1 \\
      \sqrt{(N-1)/2} &amp; j=N
 \end{cases}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Based on the previous explanation, it is straight forward to realize
that a physical signal <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span> has an equivalent representation in the
Legendre space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{u}=T^{-1}u\)</span>, the main difference however, is
that not all entries in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{u}\)</span> have the same relevance in the
physical representation of the signal. Therefore, discarding or
approximating some of the Legendre coefficients will provide fairly
accurate physical reconstruction of the signal as long as some key
elements are maintained. It is precisely this characteristic that makes
this sort of approach a relevant case study for compression algorithms
which is what we will focus in the following sections. We will initially
focus in the effect that discarding information has in the reconstructed
signal, and then analyze what needs to be stored in order for the
algorithms to effectively compress.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="down-sampling">
<h1>Down-sampling<a class="headerlink" href="#down-sampling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In signal processing, often times the high frequencies can not be
perceived by humans or are not relevant for the signal representation in
physical space. Turbulence is not an exception to this characteristic,
as it is a process with high dissipation primarily at the smallest
eddies, i.e, the higher frequencies. For this reason a natural choice of
information to discard is is precisely that contained in higher
frequencies.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, in Legendre space, the information about the signal
is contained mainly in the coefficients <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{u}\)</span>. The process of
down-sampling consist of filtering a number of the coefficients that
represent the importance of the high order Legendre polynomials (the
higher frequencies) and transforming back such that an operation as the
following is performed:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\tilde{u}=T^{-1}FTu,\]</div>
<p>Where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span> is a filtering operator that consist of a “broken
identity matrix”. Eq. <a class="reference external" href="#eq:ds-1">[eq:ds-1]</a> summarize 3 main steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Transform the signal into the Legendre space: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{u}=Tu\)</span>.</li>
<li>Filter the signal: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tilde{\hat{u}}=F\hat{u}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Transform the down-sampled coefficients back to physical space:
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tilde{u}=T^{-1}\tilde{\hat{u}}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to note 2 main points: first that
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tilde{u} \neq u\)</span> unless <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F=I\)</span>, so down-sampling
undoubtedly brings with it some errors and second that the down-sampled
coefficients contain less information than the original ones since only
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> coefficients are kept, while the rest are set to 0 trhough the
filtering matrix <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span>. The content of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tilde{\hat{u}}\)</span> will
be an array with entries arrayed in a similar fashion as shown now:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\tilde{\hat{u}}=
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{u}_0 \\
\hat{u}_1 \\
...\\
\hat{u}_{k-1} \\
\hat{u}_k \\
0 \\
.. \\
0 \\
\end{bmatrix}.\end{split}\]</div>
<p>It is possible to see that since <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tilde{\hat{u}}\)</span> has many zeros
in it, it is much easier to represent it in memory than the
reconstructed signal <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tilde{u}\)</span> and through lossless compression
algorithms that include run-length encoding or Huffman encoding, the
array in disk will only occupy the size that is needed for the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>
entries kept while the extra zeros will represent only a minor storage
overhead.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="discreet-legendre-truncation">
<h1>Discreet Legendre truncation<a class="headerlink" href="#discreet-legendre-truncation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>[&#64;Otero2018] recognized the use of down-sampling but extended it for
turbulence in spectral element methods. They realized that although
higher frequencies should have the lower energies (lower magnitude
coefficients), numerically in the Legendre space, this is not the case,
particularly when considering 3D simulations with the data structures
used in spectral element solvers.</p>
<p>Therefore they introduced extra steps to the algorithm that ensure that
it is not the higher frequencies that are filtered out, instead it is
the frequencies that posses the lower energies. The principles are still
the same as in down-sampling but instead immediately filtering out the
coefficients, first a sorting operation is performed. The algorithm is
as follow:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Transform the signal into the Legendre space: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{u}=Tu\)</span>.</li>
<li>Sort the coefficients <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{u}^{s}=sort(\hat{u})\)</span></li>
<li>Filter the sorted signal: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tilde{\hat{u}}^{s}=F\hat{u}^{s}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Unsort the signal:
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tilde{\hat{u}}=unsort(\tilde{\hat{u}}^{s})\)</span>.</li>
<li>Transform the truncated coefficients back to physical space:
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tilde{u}=T^{-1}\tilde{\hat{u}}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this case, the array <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tilde{\hat{u}}\)</span> will not possess all
the zeros grouped at the end as would be the case in down-sampling,
however with the correct encoding technique, the storage overhead is
negligible. This method has the advantage that if the same number
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> of frequencies are kept, lower errors will be obtained due to
the fact that in this method the most influential frequencies are
stored.</p>
<p>Additionally to this procedure, [&#64;Otero2018] also introduced a way to
calculate the reconstruction error at run-time without the need to
transforms back to physical space by taking advantage of 1. how the L2
norm of a physical variable is calculated and 2. the Legendre quadrature
for integration, as follows:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\lVert  u\rVert_{2}=\sqrt{\int_{\Omega}u^2 d\Omega}=\sqrt{u^TWu}=\sqrt{(T\hat{u})^TW(T\hat{u})}=\sqrt{\hat{u}^TW\hat{u}}.\]</div>
<p>This provided an efficient way to control error an compress only up to a
user predefined threshold <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon\)</span> of the error.</p>
<p>The DLT method was initially proposed in a theoretical manner but has
been since extended by to include run-time encoding and produce a fully
functioning lossy compression algorithm that in fact matches well with
the theoretical expectations one would have of such a lossy compression.</p>
<p>We have further extended the code to also control the Peak Signal To
Noise ratio:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[PSNR=20 \log{\frac{max(u)-min(u)}{\lVert  u\rVert_{2}}}\]</div>
<p>Controling this error as well, allows the procedure to control in a more
localized manner where more compression is allowed, in such a way that
in regions with high fluctuations, where the spectrum is flatter, less
error is allowed to mantain fidelity over compression.</p>
